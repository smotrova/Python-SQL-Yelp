# Python-SQL-Yelp

Clean, transform, analyse the data from Yelp using SQL and Python in order to answer business questions:

* How many reviews are in the data set?

* How many 5-star reviews are in the data set?

* What kind of experience do people share more likely? How to define positive/negative experience?

* What is a positive/negative review distribution over the years? 

* What is an amount of useful reviews in the data?

* How many reviews have no votes (no information from other users about reviews)?

* How many words are in reviews?

* Is there a sufficient difference in words used in positive/negative reviews?

* Does the difference enable one to build a good review classifier?
